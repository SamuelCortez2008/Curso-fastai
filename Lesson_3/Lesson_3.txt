|=====
| Term | Meaning
|ReLU | Function that returns 0 for negative numbers and doesn't change positive numbers.
|Mini-batch | A small group of inputs and labels gathered together in two arrays. A gradient descent step is updated on this batch (rather than a whole epoch).
|Forward pass | Applying the model to some input and computing the predictions.
|Loss | A value that represents how well (or badly) our model is doing.
|Gradient | The derivative of the loss with respect to some parameter of the model.
|Backward pass | Computing the gradients of the loss with respect to all model parameters.
|Gradient descent | Taking a step in the directions opposite to the gradients to make the model parameters a little bit better.
|Learning rate | The size of the step we take when applying SGD to update the parameters of the model.
